What is tree?
-------------------
Tree is a abstract data type(ADT) which have two disjoints sets(Data sets that have no duplicate or common elements) of data which are connected through the root node.

- Node - Fundamental building block of tree.
        - Data
        - Left pointer
        - Right pointer
- Edge - The connection between two nodes
- Root - The topmost node of tree which don't have any parent.
- Parent Node
- Child Node
- Leaf Node - A node which don't have any child.
- Subtree
- Sibling - Node which have same parent
- Ancester Node - 
- Decendent Node - 
- Level - Distance from the root node.
- Depth - The Number of eges in the longest path.
- Height of a Node - The number of edges from the node to the leaf node.


Type of tree
------------------
    1. Binary Tree (Maximum 2 child)
        - BST (Binary Search Tree)
        - AVL Tree
        - 2 Tree
        - Haffman Code tree
        - Heap Tree
        - Red Black Tree
        - Expression Tree

    2. General Tree (Maximum child - No limit) 
        - N-ary tree (Maximum child -> N)
        - MST (Multi way search tree)
        - B-Tree

BST (Binary Search Tree)
--------------------------
    - Maximum child -> 2
    - Purpose -> Searching
    - Property
        - L:Child < Root
        - R:Child > Root
    - Traversal
        - Pre Order: Root, Left, Right
        - In Order: Left, Root, Right
        - Post Order: Left, Right, Root
